    <div id="jobrole" class="infotext">
    <p>The successful candidate will contribute primarily to practice-based and seminar teaching on
    the English and Theatre undergraduate degree. You will work with the existing team of full-time
    academic staff and the theatre manager, who are together responsible for undergraduate and
    postgraduate theatre modules within the School. You will also take responsibility for delivering
    selected core studio-based practical modules taken by students following the undergraduate
    English and Theatre degree. There may also be opportunities to contribute to the MA in Theatre
    and Performance. You will contribute to the strong academic profile of the School, through the
    development of written publications and/or through practice-based research. Although the
    main research and teaching interests of the current Theatre staff relate primarily to British
    theatre since 1900, we welcome applications from any field of theatre history and performance
    practice. A practical and research interest in contemporary and experimental theatre forms
    would be an advantage; however, it is likely that the person appointed will also be expected to
    take weekly seminars on relatively broadly-based theatre modules, and to deliver some
    lectures.</p>
    <p>
    All staff are expected to assist as required with the administration of the School, to foster research
    and teaching at all levels of the curriculum, to develop research projects and related ventures, and
    to help recruit good MA and research students.</p>
